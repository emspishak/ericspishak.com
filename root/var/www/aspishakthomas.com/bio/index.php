    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Mandi Spishak-Thomas (she/her) is a post-doctoral Medicaid
      research scholar at the <a href="https://www.cshp.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers
      Center for State Health Policy</a>. Mandi's work understands health
      policies as wealth policies, investigating how Medicaid impacts
      intergenerational transfers of wealth, financial burden, and
      wealth accumulation among low-income individuals and families,
      especially birthing people and older adults.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mandi is an ardent health care advocate, abolitionist, and union
      organizer, drawing on her extensive clinical social work
      experience to remain engaged in the community. Mandi is an
      appointed member of Brooklyn's
      <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/brooklyncb6/index.page">Community
      Board 6</a> where she serves on the transportation, public
      safety, and permits and licensing committees, advocating for a
      more just and green Brooklyn. Additionally, Mandi facilitates a
      monthly caregiver support group through the
      <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> for
      adult children who care for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease
      and other related dementias.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mandi received her PhD from the Columbia School of Social Work
      where her dissertation research investigated the impacts of
      Medicaid estate recovery on intergenerational transfers of
      wealth among low-income older adults. While at Columbia, Mandi
      was a bargaining committee member, organizer, and rank-and-file
      member of the
      <a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/">Student
      Workers of Columbia</a> (UAW Local 2710).
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to pursuing a PhD, she worked as a licensed clinical
      social worker at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and
      Alzheimer's Association in San Francisco, California and
      received a master's degree in Social Work from Columbia
      University. A Southern California native and baseball enthusiast
      (Go Mets!), Mandi spends her free time training for marathons,
      biking, hiking in the Catskills, and walking her bernedoodle,
      Muppet.

<h3>Selected Comments</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mandi is an incredible instructor. She was so thoughtful in the
    planning of this course and did, what I think, is the best she
    could given the course objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mandi was amazing! You can tell she really knows her stuff and put
    so much time and effort into creating the course structure. Maybe
    I am exposing myself too much, but I have never read as many of
    the assigned readings as I did in this class. I truly enjoyed the
    readings, they never once felt like a burden to get though, and I
    learned so much from them. I also appreciated how positive and
    uplifting Mandi was about all of the work that my classmates and I
    are involved in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prof Mandi was a progressive professor which is what I seek. The
    entire course had an anti-oppressive and abolitionist lens which I
    think is so important to highlight and center in social work
    education. She also was very willing to meet outside of class to
    discuss projects which was very helpful in a 10 week course. The
    open mics were very interesting. The syllabus was amazing. I'm
    grateful to have learned from Prof Mandi.
  </li>
  <li>
    Informative, efficient with time, and gracious with her
    students. Mandi is the epitome of what a social worker should be,
    and let her students explore the deeper meanings of practice along
    with her. The class was attention-grabbing and I looked forward to
    it every week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mandi is one of the best professors I've had at CSSW. First, she
    was extremely organized. Mandi had all readings uploaded to Canvas
    and sent out the slides and a pre-course email each week. She had
    clearly put in full effort to prepare for class each week, reading
    all the discussion posts, designing beautiful slides, and bringing
    in timely topics. This effort was clear in her selection of
    readings. The syllabus is one of the best I've seen, with readings
    that very clearly related to the weekly themes of the course, were
    current and relevant, and provided a clear, rich, and engaging arc
    of learning. I also loved how she planned for guest speakers
    throughout the course to continue to connect our in-class learning
    immediately to real-world relevance. With Mandi's attentiveness
    and preparation, I felt cared for and supported as a student such
    that I could learn to the best of my ability. Mandi also struck a
    rare balance of providing useful, constructive feedback without
    being judgmental. Mandi's commitment to teaching and learning was
    so valuable. As a student, it made me feel like Mandi feel was a
    partner in our learning rather than someone trying to guide us in
    her own direction. It was clear to me that she listened to each
    student's contributions and gave her full self to every
    conversation and class session. I deeply appreciated her
    thoughtful and detailed feedback on each assignment, and
    availability in office hours to discuss our projects and
    interests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mandi was the best TA I've had this semester. She answers emails
    so timely and is great at clarification and gives great feedback
    on work. 10/10 would recommend Mandi, she is the most helpful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mandi was always there if I needed help of any sort. She was so
    organized, responsive and also highly interested in the course
    material--and it showed! Mandi is actually one of the best TA's
    I've had in my educational experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always available for consultation. Excellent lecturer too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mandi was great at providing feedback and answering questions. She
    also always provided relevant recommendations to course material.

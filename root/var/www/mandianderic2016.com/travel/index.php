  Yosemite National Park is an approximately 3-4 hour drive from multiple
  airports in the area. Here's how you get to us:

    </h2>
    <p>
      Your airport options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Oakland International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        San Francisco International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Mineta San Jose International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Sacramento International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresno Yosemite International Airport
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We recommend <strong>Oakland International Airport</strong> because it's a
      large airport and it avoids the unpredictability and nightmare that is the
      Bay Bridge traffic if you fly into San Francisco International Airport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each airport has its pros and cons so we encourage you to do your research
      and find the most convenient, easiest, and cheapest flights possible. For
      example, Fresno or Sacramento may have less traffic than leaving from one
      of the central Bay Area airports. Don't hesitate to reach out to us when
      booking your travel so we can help make it easier for you.

      Step 2: Rent a car <span class="emoji car"></span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      All airports have car rental facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pairing up with or organizing a group to carpool to Yosemite is a great
      way to save money on renting a car AND have double or triple the fun on
      the mini road trip!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to do this, but are unsure of who else is going or need
      to be paired by a professional (i.e. Eric or Mandi) we are happy to
      assist. Please shoot us a text/email/phone call and we will arrange
      accordingly.

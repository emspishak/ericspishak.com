  Yosemite National Park is an approximately 3-4 hour drive from multiple
  airports in the area. Here's how you get to us:

      Step 1: Fly <span class="emoji airplane"></span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your airport options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Oakland International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        San Francisco International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Mineta San Jose International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Sacramento International Airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresno Yosemite International Airport
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We recommend <strong>Oakland International Airport</strong> because it's a
      large airport and it avoids the unpredictability and nightmare that is the
      Bay Bridge traffic if you fly into San Francisco International Airport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each airport has its pros and cons so we encourage you to do your research
      and find the most convenient, easiest, and cheapest flights possible. For
      example, Fresno or Sacramento may have less traffic than leaving from one
      of the central Bay Area airports. Don't hesitate to reach out to us when
      booking your travel so we can help make it easier for you.

    <h2>
      Step 2: Rent a car <span class="emoji car"></span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      All airports have car rental facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pairing up with or organizing a group to carpool to Yosemite is a great
      way to save money on renting a car AND have double or triple the fun on
      the mini road trip!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to do this, but are unsure of who else is going or need
      to be paired by a professional (i.e. Eric or Mandi) we are happy to
      assist. Please shoot us a text/email/phone call and we will arrange
      accordingly.

    <p>
      <strong>Iron Door Saloon, Groveland:</strong> You've almost made it to your
      Evergreen Lodge turnout, but need to use the restroom or grab a beer? Look
      no further than the Iron Door Saloon. Opened in 1852 as The Granite Store,
      this place is packed with history, live music, and burgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        In-N-Out, various locations en route to Yosemite include: Pleasanton,
        Livermore, Tracy, Manteca:
      </strong>
      Not from California (or Texas, Arizona, Oregon, Nevada)? Enjoy what is
      arguably the best of its kind, yes, it's better than Dick's. Don't eat
      meat? No problem! Consider ordering a Mandi &amp; Eric classic, the grilled
      cheese. And don't forget to order a Neapolitan milkshake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Note: Eric and Mandi have previously tested out and pre-approved each of
        these locations for you.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hula's, Escalon:</strong> Do you love soft serve ice cream? In the
      mood for a juicy burger and some sweet potato fries or onion rings? You may
      be skeptical when you roll up to the strip mall, but trust us, this place
      is worth the stop!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Docs Q N Pit Stop, Modesto:</strong> This soul food has soul. In
      the mood for some hearty meat and aren't a vegetarian like Eric and Mandi
      are? Are you really just in it for the sides of mac and cheese and black
      eyed peas? Look no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>June Bug Cafe, Midpines</strong>: Looking for vegetarian or vegan
      fare? Try the heirloom tomatoes, mediterranean plate, or veggie spinach
      wrap for a healthy option on your drive.

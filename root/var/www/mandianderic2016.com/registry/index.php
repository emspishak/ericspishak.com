  Mandi and Eric are not ashamed to admit that prior to living
  together one might consider them "moochers". Yes, Mandi and Eric
  consistently brought little to the table in the form of home or
  kitchen goods when living with roommates. It worked out pretty well
  for awhile that is until they decided to move in together. These two
  all of a sudden were headed to Target for a $200+ trip to purchase
  literally anything one might need for a basic kitchen and home
  including everything from a whisk to drinking glasses. Needless to
  say our registries below will help us to finally replace the
  borderline dangerous items we have used over the last three years
  (we say dangerous because we indeed had a knife snap in half while
  we were cooking one evening).

  Mandi and Eric discovered their love for this local ceramics shop
  shortly after moving to San Francisco. Mandi has since taken a tour
  of their San Francisco studio learning all about their company
  history and tile making process and has attended various events in
  their lovely studio space. Needless to say it was a no brainer
  deciding to register for dishes, serving bowls and platters at a
  place so near and dear to our hearts. Consider buying local and
  supporting our love of handmade ceramics by purchasing a registry
  gift from Heath. We promise to have you over for dinner served on
  their gorgeous dishes soon!

  Williams-Sonoma is one of those stores that you walk around in and
  dream of getting married so you can register for their amazing pots,
  pans, and beautiful cooking utensils. Oh, you don't do that, is it
  just us? Thanks to Mandi's big sister for all of the registry
  guidance and encouragement on going big with the All Clad
  pans. Mandi loves to cook and maybe someday Eric will learn how so
  we guarantee these gifts to be put to good use.

  Crate and Barrel, ole reliable. Although we became overwhelmed in
  our registry endeavor at this monstrous store, there is nothing not
  to love about their home goods and kitchen essentials. Mandi and
  Eric have been slowly turning their apartment into a home that feels
  like them and are thrilled about getting to complete their mission
  with these perfect Crate and Barrel finds.

  We encourage all guests to stay on-site
  at <a href="http://www.evergreenlodge.com/" target="_blank">The
  Evergreen Lodge</a> as it is where all of the wedding weekend events
  will be taking place making it convenient and fun for
  everyone. Think summer camp, but for adults. Please note: there is a
  two-night minimum.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  We understand weddings can add up and highly encourage everyone to
  shack up together to save some money and make some new friends. Most
  of the cabins sleep 4 people, if not more, making it an easy option
  to split the bill. Don't know anyone else coming to the wedding?
  Don't be afraid to reach out to us! Just as we're happy to arrange
  your carpool from the airport to the park, we're happy to arrange
  your weekend roomies!
</p>

<p>
  Of course if you're wanting a romantic weekend away, by all means
  get your own cabin. The cabins are downright charming and we know
  you'll love them as much as we do!
</p>

<h2>How to Book</h2>

<p>
  We have a room block reserved for the wedding. You must call to book
  a room in our wedding block and get our room prices (unfortunately,
  you cannot book online). Our room block is reserved until June 23rd
  and we only have a limited number of rooms so please book early!
  Trust us, there will be no availability elsewhere as Yosemite
  National Park has campgrounds and hotels book up a year out.
</p>

<p>
  To book, please call The Evergreen Lodge
  at
  <span class="desktop-only"><strong>(209) 379-2606</strong></span>
  <span class="mobile-only"><a href="tel:209-379-2606">(209) 379-2606</a></span>
  and tell them you'd like to book a room for the
  Thomas/Spishak wedding on September 24, 2016.
</p>

<h2>Other On-site Treats</h2>

<p>
  The majority of the wedding weekend will be taken care of by us
  meaning, there is pretty much only one meal you will have to forge
  yourself. We thought it would be helpful to list a few other
  commodities available to you, including where to get breakfast the
  day of the wedding!

  As for activities to keep you entertained when Mandi and Eric are
  not entertaining you with their vows, dance moves, and bottomless
  bloody marys. There is a pretty unbelievable salt water pool at the
  lodge that offers a poolside barbecue, poolside bar, and just in
  general a gorgeous setting to take a dip. Fall in the love with the
  pool <a href="http://www.evergreenlodge.com/play/yosemite-swimming-pool-area/"

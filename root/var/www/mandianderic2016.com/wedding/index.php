  Climb along nature's "giant staircase," where you are rewarded with close-up
  views of two waterfalls and numerous geologic features (depending on how far
  you choose to hike). Powerful and turbulent, these two waterfalls will soak you
  in spring and entice you year-round.

  and surrounding peaks.
</p>

<h4>
  Wapama Falls - 5 miles round trip (3 hours), 20 minute drive
</h4>
<p>
  Wapama Fall is reached via a hike that follows the shoreline of the reservoir
  with moderate up and downhill hiking. The trail includes spectacular views of
  Tueeulala and Wapama Falls.

<p>
  On September 24, 2016, Eric Spishak and Mandi Thomas will finally
  get to marry each other!
</p>
<p>
  As you know, it's been years in the making, and finally after many
  late nights Pinteresting, months venue shopping, and too many DIY
  projects to count, it's all coming together. Our labor of love is
  becoming a reality, and what better way to celebrate this joyus
  occasion than spend it with you!
</p>
<p>
  If you've received an invitation, it's because you truly are dear to
  our hearts... or just because you may be an amazing gift giver
  (fingers crossed for both!). Either way, we are thrilled to have our
  friends and family join us on this very special weekend.
</p>
<p>
  But wait, let's not forget that this a destination wedding, so it is
  important that you check this website for updates and info regarding
  this event. If you have any further questions, or simply can't find
  the information you're looking for on the site, don't hesitate to
  give Eric a ring, I'm sure he knows all the details and I doubt he's
  very busy.
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to seeing you all in Yosemite!

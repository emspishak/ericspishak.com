  On September 24, 2016, Eric Spishak and Mandi Thomas will finally
  get to marry each other! The months of planning, Pinteresting,
  calling and emailing our wedding planner, and all of our DIY
  projects will have been worth it and we will get to see the fruits
  of our labor of love become a reality. If you received an invitation
  is is because you are dear to our hearts or because we imagine you
  would be a great gift giver. Either way, we are excited to spend
  such a special weekend with our friends and family. You should find
  all the information you will need about the wedding weekend on our
  website and if not, give Eric a call. I'm sure he knows all the
  details and I doubt he's very busy. We look forward to seeing you
  all in Yosemite!
